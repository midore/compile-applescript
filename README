# I got e-mail from 'The Softpedia Team' <http://www.softpedia.com/>
# 'The Softpedia Team' sayed
# "... compile-applescript, one of your products, has been added to Softpedia's
# database of software programs for Mac OS. ..."
#
# I was surprised this e-mail. I don't know what is <www.softpedia.com>, I've never e-mail to <www.softpedia.com>.
# What is it? Why?... and besides, I notice 'compile-applescript' does't work in OS X 10.6.2 .
#
# But now, 'compile-applescript' has been added to Softpedia's database, already.
# So, I add file "OSX10-6-2-compile.applescript" which fix something error. For somebody else want to use it.
# I can't write 'fluently English'. Thanks for read this.
